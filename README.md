# This is a network intrusion detection model

This is a binary classification problem.
The no.of features are 40+ , hence certain dimensionality reductions needs to be done to preserve as much information as possible and reduce the dimension of the feature space.
Several machine learning algorithms have been used to classify the instance as NORMAL or ANOMALY.
The random forest ML algorithm has outperformed other algorithms in terms of binary_classification accuracy.
